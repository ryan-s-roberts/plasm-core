### Changed

- **Binary names:** remote HTTP terminal is now **`plasm`** (`plasm`, `--bin plasm`); the local appliance binary is **`plasm-server`** (Cargo package **`plasm-server`**, directory `crates/plasm-server`; formerly **`plasm-appliance`**); the dev/schema CLI is **`plasm-cgs`** (`plasm-cli`, `--bin plasm-cgs`). Former names: `plasm-cgs` (agent), `plasm-appliance`, `plasm` (cli).
- **Workspace versions:** all `plasm-oss` crates use `version.workspace = true` with a single `[workspace.package] version` in the root `Cargo.toml`.
